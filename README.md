## Concultion

first of all this side project was just an experiment to understand PCA and LDA in my studies 
comparing the result accuracy of PCA which is 57.5% and LDA which is 28.75%, PCA is far better

but 57.5% accuracy is not particularly very good at all, 

one reason I could think of is that PCA uses variance and the variance in my data is not very seen as the data is either a black or a white pixel

love to hear anyone's opinion on the project or how it could be improved
